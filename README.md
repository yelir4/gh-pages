# gh-pages
setting up github pages for a website/portfolio
this website page makes use of html, css, js, and vue
using the node.js + npm framework for testing and such


# what is going on in this repository?

**index.html** the website's initial page, which everything is mercilessly loaded into
**package-lock.json, package.json** i dont know...
**vite.config.js** something to do with vite which i dont know either

**./public/favicon.ico** image icon in the tab bar

**./src** has a lot of important stuff
for instance,
**App.vue** is the main source of our vue reactive code
**main.js** is called directly by `index.html` and calls for `App.vue`

**./src/assets** continuing on the assets folder has most of our css, `main.css` for example lives here
**./src/components** finally some vue component files which mostly act as reactive html that we can plug in where needed i suppose


thanks for reading
